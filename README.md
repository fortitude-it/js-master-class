JavaScript Master Class
=======================

This repo serves as a list of useful links for getting up to speed (and keeping up) with JS, and the latest JS concepts that are important to use-cases of teams that I personally work on. This list may not be widely applicable.


Books
-----

These book recommendations are all a bit dated. ES6 has brought massive changes and improvements to the language. That said, they’re still highly relevant and definitely worth reading. It’s just worth noting they should be read through the lens of “There may be a better way nowadays”.


- **JavaScript: The Good Parts by Douglas Crockford** ([link][books-1])  
  Some would consider this the “JavaScript Bible” I don’t know that I’d go that far, but it’s an important book and worth the read. It’s pretty short.
- **Effective JavaScript** ([link][books-2])  
  This book will cause you to repeatedly say “Ah, I didn’t realize that”
- **JavaScript Patterns** ([link][books-3])  
  Great book giving you some pragmatic solutions to the most common problems you have to address when writing JavaScript.

Articles/Blog posts
-------------------



- **The Two Pillars of JavaScript**  
  This series is written by Eric Elliot. He’s an anti-class zealot, and he shamelessly plugs his library “stampit.js”… That said, he’s a really smart dude and has some really important stuff to say in these articles. I consider this mandatory reading.
    - **Part 1** - *(12 min read)* ([link][reading-1])
    - **Part 2** - *(14 min read)* ([link][reading-2])
- **Facebook Just Taught Us All How To Build Websites** *(4 min read)* ([link][reading-3])
- **Removing User Interface Complexity, or Why React is Awesome** *(15 min read)* ([link][reading-4])  
  This blog post is the first thing that actually made me begin to take react.js seriously. Really worth the read.
- **Truth, Equality, and JavaScript** *(10 min read)* ([link][reading-5])  
  Wrap your head around ==, === and truthiness / falsieness in javascript.
- **Classical Inheritance in JavaScript** *(20 min read)* ([link][reading-6])  
  Demonstration of various inheritance patterns in JavaScript, and why classical inheritance isn’t a good fit.

Videos
------


- **Intro to Immutable.js** *(30 min)* ([link][video-1])
- **Immediate Mode vs Retain Mode** *(40 min*) ([link][video-2])  
  This video isn’t actually a JavaScript video, nor is it a React video. However, the concepts he discusses are the abstract concepts that underpin React. He gives the most concise argument against shared mutable state and for declarative style architecture that I’ve heard so far.
- **The Rise of Async JavaScript and RxJS Observables** *(50 min)* ([link][video-3])  
  Great overview of all js async patterns culminating in an amazing explanation of observables.
