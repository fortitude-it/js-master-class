This repo serves as a list of useful links for getting up to speed (and keeping up) with JS, and the latest JS concepts that are important to use-cases of teams that I personally work on. This list may not be widely applicable.


Books

These book recommendations are all a bit dated. ES6 has brought massive changes and improvements to the language. That said, they’re still highly relevant and definitely worth reading. It’s just worth noting they should be read through the lens of “There may be a better way nowadays”.

JavaScript: The Good Parts by Douglas Crockford (link)
Some would consider this the “JavaScript Bible” I don’t know that I’d go that far, but it’s an important book and worth the read. It’s pretty short.

Effective JavaScript (link)
This book will cause you to repeatedly say “Ah, I didn’t realize that”

The Two Pillars of JavaScript
This series is written by Eric Elliot. He’s an anti-class zealot, and he shamelessly plugs his library “stampit.js”… That said, he’s a really smart dude and has some really important stuff to say in these articles. I consider this mandatory reading.

Immediate Mode vs Retain Mode (40 min) (link)
This video isn’t actually a JavaScript video, nor is it a React video. However, the concepts he discusses are the abstract concepts that underpin React. He gives the most concice argument against shared mutable state and for declarative style architecture that I’ve heard so far.
